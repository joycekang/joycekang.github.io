*About*
Hello, World! I'm an MD/PhD student at [Harvard-MIT](https://www.hms.harvard.edu/md_phd/index.html) and an incoming dermatology resident at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://dermatology.upenn.edu/), following a Transitional Year at [MSKCC](https://www.mskcc.org/hcp-education-training/residencies/medicine-transitional-year-residency). My PhD in the [Raychaudhuri Lab](https://sites.broadinstitute.org/immunogenomics) focused on building scalable computational algorithms for single-cell genomics and human genetics.

More recently, I've been exploring the intersection of AI and healthcare delivery. Alongside my training, I’ve worked as a data science consultant for companies including Prometheus Biosciences and Aditum Bio. Previously, I studied Computer Science at Stanford, where I wrote my honors thesis on metagenomics in the [Bhatt Lab](https://www.bhattlab.com/).
